    // To create a Scanner for a file, use new Scanner(new File(filename)).
    // This statement may throw an exception. Java forces you to write the code to deal with exceptions.
    // One way to deal with it is to declare throws Exception in the method declaration.
    // If the close() method is not invoked, the problem will run fine.
    // But it is a good practice to close the file to release the resource on the file.
